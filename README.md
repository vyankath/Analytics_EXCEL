**Project Title:** Navigating the Complexities of Airline and Airport Operations

**Problem Statements:** The company has access to extensive datasets that cover a wide range of information, including flight schedules, delays, airline operations, and airport traffic details. These datasets offer a unique opportunity to explore and understand the multifaceted nature of the aviation industry, from operational efficiency and customer satisfaction to logistical challenges and environmental impact.

**Objectives:** The primary objective of this case study, titled "Sky Analytics: Navigating the Complexities of Airline and Airport Operations," is to deeply analyze and interpret the extensive datasets The analysis aims to uncover critical insights into flight operations, delay patterns, airline efficiency, and airport traffic dynamics. By exploring these datasets, the study seeks to identify key factors influencing operational efficiency, understand the intricacies of flight scheduling and delays, and evaluate the performance metrics of airlines and airports. The ultimate goal is to provide strategic recommendations to enhance operational effectiveness, improve customer experiences in air travel, and contribute to the overall advancement of the aviation industry's standards and practices.

**Data source:** Dataset contains three files flights, airlines, and airports - namely "flights.csv", "airlines.csv", and "airports.csv". The flights.csv' dataset contains detailed information on flight operations, including arrival time, departure time, different delays, and cancellation information. The ‘airlines.csv’ dataset provides details of Airline code and name. and "airports.csv"  dataset provides details of Airport code and name.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Imported and used transform tab there were some null values and needed to change datatype. Merged airline and flights dataset using IATA code from airline and airline column from flights were common column i.e. foreign key. Data quality was good, had only missing values in some column and filled with appropriate values. Converted different delays into proper time i.e. in minutes. Created new features like flight status and haul-type.

**Insights:** In a comprehensive analysis of the aviation data, several key insights have been unearthed, shedding light on various aspects of airline and airport operations.

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport emerges as the busiest airport within the top five, boasting the highest combined count of incoming and outgoing flights. Skywest Airlines Inc. stands out with the highest cancellation rate among the listed airlines, signaling potential challenges or operational issues. A closer look at seasonal patterns reveals that January records the highest total number of flight cancellations, suggesting a potential seasonal trend, while February exhibits the highest average flight delay, indicating a seasonal influence on delays.
Exploring the relationship between average flight distance and delays for different airlines uncovers diverse patterns, emphasizing the need for individualized considerations. On-time performance varies significantly among airlines, with Southwest Airlines Co achieving the best record and Frontier Airlines experiencing the lowest. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport maintains efficient operations despite extensive connectivity, demonstrating lower average delays.
Cumulative impact analysis highlights Frontier Airlines as facing the highest overall impact due to a combination of frequent delays and extended delay durations. In terms of flight path efficiency, Frontier Airlines stands out with the highest optimization in minimizing travel time. Analyzing specific days of the week reveals that Monday has the highest average flight delay and cancellations, while Sunday experiences the longest average delay.
Examining the airports and destinations, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport serves the most destinations, totaling 156. Further insights reveal that United Airlines Inc. exhibits the least deviation from scheduled flight time, and American Airlines Inc. demonstrates the highest fleet utilization rate. Lastly, a breakdown of delay types showcases American Eagle Airlines Inc. recording the highest total of air system delays, while American Airlines Inc. leads in weather delays. Additionally, WN holds the highest number of both long-haul and short-haul flights, highlighting their versatility in flight operations.
